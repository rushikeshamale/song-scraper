# song-scraper
This repository/project is intended for Educational Purposes ONLY. It is not intended to be used for any purpose other than learning, so please do not use it for any other reason than to learn about scraping!!  Please do not open issues complaining that the code is "Not Working" ...  MyMp3Songs have every right to change their UI as they see fit.  When they do change their UI the scraper will inevitably "break"!
